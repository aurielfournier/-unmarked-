unmarked/my dissertation
========

I'm using packaged 'unmarked' to do much of the modeling for my dissertation. This is where all that code is being kept along with associated scripts and things. I'm pretty good at trouble shooting unmarked, so if you have questions shoot them my way (aurielfournier@gmail.com) but the [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/unmarked) is much better/wiser then I.
